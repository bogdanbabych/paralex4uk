    purpose:
        - build resources for evaluation and development of CL systems:
            > MT
            > automated transfer of annotation
            > parallel corpora and terminology support
            > word embedding models
            > ontology induction
            > ontology-guided and low-resource MT
            
            > theoretical topics
                - theory of representations
                - adaptability of training examples and training corpora
                - discovering translation equivalents
                - support of monolingual authoring

    - desription and replication of the workflow
    - concept of the corpus and reusability of the code
    - specification of the format and interface design 
    
    
    
    specifications:
        xml --> monolingual with identifiers:
            > input for PoS tagging / parsing;
            > MT output generation
            > use of xml libraries for processing
            
            >> preserving the structure 
        tmx doesn't preserve information about text structure / layout;
            >> tmx output as one of the transformations
            
            
        alignment
            maximal aligned units can be identified in each stage:
                - corpus --> then using dict models / similarity metrics to find 
                - text --> paragraphs / sentences 
                - paragraph --> sentences 
                - sentence --> phrases / words
                
        output
            tmx
            one sent per line
            discourse - level representations
            pos-tagged aligned structures (vrt)
            paired sentence pairs/triplets
            
        possible extensions to terminology, MWE, entity annotations
        possibilities of construction annotations / treebanks

    structure of the corpus:
        - interviews
        
    
    further development: 
    corpus of literary translation
    poetry translations (both directions)
    

    - morphological support (a separate project)
    - disrouces
    - construction grammar induction
    - semantic representations
    - terminology
    
    - linking dictionary support
    - interoperability with models
